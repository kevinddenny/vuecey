        <p class="mainP">Despite its modest size, Sri Lanka is among the top five biodiversity hotspots
           in the world and has one of the highest rates of biological endemism in the world, 
           whether in plants or animals. Asian elephants, sloth bears, leopards, sambar, and 
           wild buffaloes draw the most of the interest of wildlife enthusiasts out of the 
           ninety-one species of mammals present in Sri Lanka. The Red Slender Loris, Toque 
           Macaque, and Purple-faced Langur, however, are the rarest mammals in Sri Lanka and 
           are deemed to be endangered owing to habitat loss by the IUCN.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="mainP">
           Large families of cetaceans, including powerful blue whales, 
           sperm whales, and playful dolphins, reside in the seas near Sri Lanka. 
           The waterways around the nation are home to 26 different species of cetaceans, making it 
           one of the greatest places in the world to go whale and dolphin watching.<br>
           
           Although the island is home to unique amphibians and powerful elephants, birds are 
           the pride of Sri Lanka's fauna. With over 433 bird species, 233 of which are resident, 
           Sri Lanka is home to 20 endemic species. In contrast to their relatives on the Indian 
           mainland, another 80 species have formed unique Sri Lankan races.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="mainP">
           Despite receiving less attention, Sri Lanka is home to one of the world's highest 
           diversitys of amphibians, with over 106 species, of which over 90 are endemic. 
           With a significant concentration in the Sinharaja rainforest, the nation has 
           long asserted that it boasts the world's largest density of amphibian species.<br>

            <h3>NATIONAL PARK OF LAHUGALA</h3>
            <img id="boximg" src="Images/Lahugala.jpg" alt="Lahugala">
            <p>On Sri Lanka's east coast, not far from Arugam Bay, sits Lahugala, the country's 
               smallest national park. It may be tiny, but it is well constructed, and the parks' 
               extensive beru grass cover makes it a favorite feeding spot for the region's 500 Asian elephants.<br></p>
    
               <p>Another feature of the park is that it is one of the few that really allows you to get out of the car 
               and go for a walk, giving you a chance to get some exercise and learn more about the surrounding environment. 
               The water-filled wewas also include several lily species, which in turn support a variety 
               of insects and birds in addition to the beru grass. A sizable population of grey langurs, 
               wild pigs, spotted deer, as well as a huge variety of wading birds and raptors, 
               are also found in the park.<br></p>

            <img id="boximg" src="Images/wilpattu.jpg" alt="Wilpattu">
            <p>
                Experience Sri Lanka's most secretive animals in Wilpattu National Park's 
                immense isolation. This is Sri Lanka's largest and oldest wildlife reserve, 
                taking up a sizable area of land that borders the northwestern coast's copper-sand 
                beaches, the Cultural Triangle's ancient ruins, and the Northern Province.</p>
                <p>The park supports amazing birdlife, Asian elephants, Sri Lankan leopards, 
                  and Sri Lankan sloth bears in addition to being home to other rare species. <br></p>

            <h3>YALA NATIONAL PARK</h3>
            <img id="boximg" src="Images/yala.jpg" alt="Yala">
            <p>
                Yala is a national park combined with a stringent nature reserve. The park, which is 
                divided into 5 blocks, protects an area of territory covering close to 130,000 hectares and 
                is made up of light woods, scrubs, grasslands, tanks, and lagoons. The public may 
                now access two blocks. <br></p>
    
                <p>Yala was established as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900 and as a national park in 1938. 
                It is located in Sri Lanka's south-east, abutting the expansive Indian Ocean. Ironically, 
                while Britain was in power, the park was first utilized as a hunting area for the affluent. 
                215 bird species and 44 different types of mammals may be found in Yala. The largest 
                concentration of leopards, stately elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, 
                peacocks, and crocodiles are just a few of its most well-known inhabitants. <br></p>

            <h3>MINNERIYA NATIONAL PARK</h3>
            <img id="boximg" src="Images/Minneriya.jpg" alt="Minneriya">
                <p>In Sri Lanka's North Central Province, 182 miles from Colombo, is where you'll find Minneriya 
                National Park. Habarana and Polonnaruwa are the two significant cities nearest to Minneriya 
                National Park. <br></p>
    
                <p>The main point of the Minneriya National Park is the restored, sizable, historic Minneriya 
                Rainwater Reservoir, which irrigates a sizable portion of the district of Polonnaruwa.<br>
                Being a part of the elephant corridor that connects Minneriya National Park with Kaudulla 
                and Wasgamuwa National Parks allows visitors to view elephant herds all year round. The best 
                time to visit Minneriya National Park is from May to October in order to see the famed Great 
                Elephant Gathering of Asian wild elephants. <br></p>

            <h3>UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK</h3>
            <img id="boximg" src="Images/udawalawa.webp" alt="Udawalawe">
                <p>In order to provide a sanctuary for species driven out by the construction of the Uda Walawe dam, 
                Udawalawe National Park was established in 1972.
                It has 119 square miles of open grassland, with marshes and deep vegetation, and is backed 
                by the magnificent hills to the north. If your children adore elephants, an Udawalawe National 
                Park safari is a fantastic option for a Sri Lankan safari because it has about 500 resident elephants. <br></p>
                
                <p>Of all the Sri Lankan national parks, it boasts the highest density of Asian elephants. Elephant 
                sightings are almost a given on a safari through Udawalawe National Park because of the abundance 
                of water that draws them there.<br></p>

            <h3>PINNAWALA ELEPHANT ORPHANAGE</h3>
            <img id="boximg" src="Images/Pinnawala.jpg" alt="pinnawala">
               <p>As its name indicates, the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage (PEO) has a special approach to caring 
               for ex-situ animals. Its popularity and success spread not just across the nation but also 
               around the world, making Pinnawala synonymous with the Sri Lankan elephant. <br></p>
    
               <p>The idea was realized by the late Hon. Minister Kalugalle on February 16, 1975, and is 
               now home to 93 elephants. At the time, Pinnawala was a fairly distant location with luxuriant 
               coconut plantations and, most importantly, a place where mahouts were not hard to come by. 
               Additionally, the presence of "Ma oya" running nearby helps to augment the enormous amount 
               of water needed by the elephants. <br></p>
