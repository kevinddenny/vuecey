            Sri Lanka, a relatively small island, with a wide range of topographies, 
            climatic conditions, and natural characteristics. The notorious beaches of 
            Sri Lanka have long drawn tourists. The rest of the island, though, has 
            a lot more picturesque landscapes.<br>

            Emerald tea plantations and sporadic waterfalls are scattered 
            across the central highlands. Cool temperatures, foggy vistas, 
            and charming estate cottages are remnants of bygone periods.<br>

            Beautiful sunrises, luxuriant paddy fields, and a slower, more rural 
            pace of life may all be found on the island's east. Any tired traveler 
            will find solace in the vibrant houses of worship, national parks, ports 
            and harbors, and crystal-clear waterways.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>LIPTON'S SEAT</h3>
            This beautiful trek leads you through the tea plantations to the viewpoint
             rumored to be Sir Thomas Lipton's favorite place to come and quietly 
             reflect and watch his estates. It begins at the ancient Dambatenne Tea 
             Factory in the Hill Country. On a clear day, it is possible to see all 
             the way to the shore from this vantage point, which rivals the 
             view from World's End.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Although it is not very difficult and older kids should have no trouble 
            doing it, keep in mind that climbing any distance in the heat might be 
            exhausting and that carrying water and supplies would be necessary.<br>
        </p>

            <h3>TRAIN THROUGH THE HILL COUNTRY</h3>
            The renowned rail system in Sri Lanka was built during the British colonial 
            era and is still a fascinating, archaic system today. There may not be 
            a finer or more pleasant way to see this amazing region of the country 
            than on this spectacular mountain road that winds majestically through 
            some of the island's least welcoming mountain routes. <br>
        </p>

        <p>One of Sri Lanka's most memorable adventures is the train ride from 
            Kandy up into the highest regions of the highlands, which passes through 
            heavily forested tea estates, isolated villages, and breathtaking waterfalls.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>HORTON PLAINS & WORLDS END</h3>

            In the shadow of Sri Lanka's second and third tallest mountains, The Horton 
            Plains is a stunning, peaceful, and mysterious place with some amazing walks. <br>

            The plains itself comprise an undulating plateau with a high percentage of species that 
            are indigenous to the area. The area, which is at an elevation of 2,100-2,300 
            meters and was designated a national park in 1988, is characterized by untamed 
            grasslands, scattered patches of dense forest, rocky outcrops, filigree waterfalls, 
            and hazy lakes.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The plateau comes to an abrupt stop at Worlds End, where a stunning escarpment 
            sees the ground plunge 880 metres. If lucky enough, you will beat the fog and mist 
            to be able to see jaw dropping views of miniature tea plantation villages in the valley 
            below, all the way out to the south coast.<br>

            Wake early for a walk through Horton Plains National Park up to Worlds End to avoid 
            the view being shrouded in mist and dont forget to pause a while at the 20 metre high 
            Bakers Falls, a waterfall formed by the tributary Belihul Oya and named after Sir Samuel 
            Baker, a hunter, explorer and early settler at Nuwara Eliya.<br>

        <h3>SINHARAJA RAINFOREST</h3>
            Sinharaja, in the southwest of Sri Lanka, is the last remaining piece of 
            primary tropical rainforest in the nation. The trees make up more than 
            60% of the population, and many of them are unusual. There is a lot of 
            endemic wildlife in the reserve, notably birds, but there are also many 
            different kinds of insects, reptiles, and uncommon amphibians, as well 
            as more than half of Sri Lanka's endemic butterfly and mammal species.
