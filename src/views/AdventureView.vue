        Sri Lanka provides a variety of activities from the top of the mountains
        to the bottom of the oceans due to the diverse climates and geography
        crammed into a tiny island.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="mainP"> 
        The most popular beach activities in the nation are scuba diving and
        surfing, followed by swimming in the water and snorkeling. In this
        nation, scuba diving has a lengthy history. Today's waters are home to a
        variety of exotic species, coral gardens, and historic wrecks. One of
        the greatest diving experiences in the world can be found in Sri Lanka.
        Although relatively new to the nation, surfing has developed a name for
        itself on the island's southern and eastern shores during the past 25
        years. While white river rafting, kayaking, and canoeing are among of
        the country's more recent water activities, the sea around Sri Lanka is
        also one of the most difficult sites for marine game fishing.<br />
      </p>
      <p class="mainP">
        Sri Lanka has various options for avid hikers and trekkers with its
        numerous routes flowing through rising mountains, beautiful green
        forests, paddy fields, parks, and tranquil villages. Earlier this year,
        a fresh activity called trail blazing along the tracks and routes on
        horseback or even an elephant was offered.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="mainP">
        Take on waterfall climbing with thrilling climbs like the granite face
        of Bambarakanda waterfall, the tallest in the nation, and experience the
        thrills of crumbling rocks beneath the feet, head spinning heights, and
        the earth stretching beneath.<br />

        Sri Lanka is an adventure waiting to happen, with several experiences
        crammed within a few kilometres of one another.<br />

          <h3>WHALE WATCHING</h3>
          <img id="boximg" src="Images/whalewatching.jpg" alt="whale watching">
          <p>
            One of the most thrilling aquatic activities you can partake in while 
            on vacation in Sri Lanka is whale and dolphin watching. The world's largest 
            mammal, the frequently sighted blue whale, may be seen in Sri Lanka, which is 
            the ideal location for whale and dolphin watching excursions.</p>
            
            <p>When you go on a whale/dolphin viewing tour off the Southern, 
              Eastern, or West coast of Sri Lanka, the ever-smiling, mischievous 
              dolphins will put on a show while some of the oldest and largest marine 
              creatures, the humpback and the blue whales, will casually glide by you. 
              Dondra Point, which is reachable from Galle, Hikkaduwa, and Mirissa, and 
              Trincomalee are the best places to see whales, while the waters around Kalpitiya 
              are teeming with dolphins.
              </p>
            
          <p>The Sri Lanka Coast Guards have heightened their vigilance in observing the 
            application of the Sea Mammals Observation, Regulation, and Control Regulations 
            as the whale-watching season is in full swing and a large number of domestic and 
            international visitors are congregating in the harbor.

          <p>
            In the shadow of Sri Lanka's second and third tallest mountains, The
            Horton Plains is a stunning, peaceful, and mysterious place with some
            amazing walks. The plains itself comprise an undulating plateau with a
            high percentage of species that are indigenous to the area. The area,
            which is at an elevation of 2,100-2,300 meters and was designated a
            national park in 1988, is characterized by untamed grasslands, scattered
            patches of dense forest, rocky outcrops, filigree waterfalls, and hazy
            lakes.<br />
          </p>
    
          <p>
            To avoid the view being obscured by fog, get up early and take a walk
            through Horton Plains National Park to World's End. Don't forget to stop
            at the 20-meter-high Bakers Falls, which is a waterfall created by the
            tributary Belihul Oya and named after Sir Samuel Baker, a hunter,
            explorer, and early settler in Nuwara Eliya.<br />
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Your trip in the highlands would benefit greatly from visiting Horton
            Plains, a fascinating wilderness with a wide diversity of flora and

          <h3>KITE SURFING</h3>
          <img id="boximg" src="Images/KiteSurfing.jpg" alt="Kite Surfing">
        <p>
          The water sport with the fastest global growth is kite surfing. It is
          not kite flying, wind surfing, waveboarding, surfing, or any other type
          of water sport. The most extreme new water sport in years is the result
          of the merging of these disciplines with additional influences. It has
          now reached Sri Lanka, which has several fantastic areas for safely
          engaging in the activity.<br />
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Kite surfing is a "extreme sport" that has to be practiced under
          supervision and with the right training. When mastered, it is incredibly
          thrillingâ€”a true adrenaline sport! These introductory classes will give
          you the opportunity to fully grasp controlling the kite on land, which
          is a prerequisite before trying to kitesurf. Before studying in the
          water, these courses are meant to help you understand the theory and put
          it into practice on dry land.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          A "Kite-safari," which may be customized to meet your needs as well,
          would likely be of interest to experienced kite-surfers or those who
          have finished the courses.

          <p>
            In Sri Lanka, whitewater rafting excursions are fairly accessible,
            particularly on the Kelani river beginning in Kitulgala. While still
            dangerous, the rafting in this area is not as "wild" as it is in some
            other places, which makes it a suitable place for beginners to try the
            sport. It's also great for small groups like families.<br />

          <h3>DEEP SEA FISHING</h3>
          <img id="boximg" src="Images/DeepSeaFishing.jpg" alt="Deep Sea Fishing">
          <p>
          A morning spent deep sea fishing in the Indian Ocean, which surrounds
          Bentota, Sri Lanka, is a magnificent experience because of the abundance
          of Tuna, Jack Fish, Red & White Snappers, Barracuda, sharks, groupers,
          and the gorgeous Wahoo.<br />
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Early in the morning, you will be picked up at the Malubanna jetty, and
          you will spend 4-5 hours fishing off the coast of Bentota, Sri Lanka. If
          you are successful, the fisherman will choose their favorites from your
          catch for you to eat for supper that night.<br />
  
          The remainder of your catch will be sold at market, and half of the
          money will go to your guides and half will go to a foundation that
          supports local fishermen's growth.<br />
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Try lagoon fishing during the off-season. This occurs in the more
          tranquil waters around the river mouth and farther upstream, where you
          may catch mangrove jacks, snapper, mullet, and catfish. Lagoon fishing
          is a fantastic opportunity to take in the wildlife and river beauty in
          the area of Bentota, Sri Lanka. Go fishing for a few hours in the early
          morning or late afternoon.<br />
